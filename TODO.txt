Description
=

The program can extract any *.npk archives designed for the game "Project Nomads"
*This program can be useful for another game named "Drakensang". (need to check it)

Knowing issues
=

The program can extract the content of the *npk archives and create them.

The problem only occurs when I create the archive, and then load it with my program and extract
it. 
I found that some parts of the file is missing. (tested it multiple times with .txt files, with NotePad++).
